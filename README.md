Welcome to the Web App. Currently, this is a playground of a web application that I 
hope to put plenty of time into to learn some cool stuff in the world of programming.
Far too long have I kept my nose in backend-only programming where I got very little
real world front-end training. In the end I hope to have an up and running 
web application under a different name that can do some cool stuff. It may
even be a collection of things, who knows?



## Features

Nothing yet! This is an empty project with nothing but place holders!


## Installation
The typical installation guide for a node project

This project can be
installed using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), either globally or locally, by
running:

```sh
npm install 
```

Hopefully in the future I can get this on npm itself.

## Contributing

There is little need to contribute to this unless it desired to show me
a better way to do something or make a general improvement to something 
that is killing the project in the background.
