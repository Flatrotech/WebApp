[Web App](https://flatrotech-studios.web.app/)
================

Welcome to the Web App. Currently, this is a playground of a web application that I 
hope to put plenty of time into to learn some cool stuff in the world of programming.
Far too long have I kept my nose in backend-only programming where I got very little
real world front-end training. In the end I hope to have an up and running 
web application under a different name that can do some cool stuff. It may
even be a collection of things, who knows?



## Features

Nothing yet! This is an empty project with nothing but place holders!


## Installation
The typical installation guide for a node project

This project can be
installed using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), either globally or locally, by
running:

```sh
npm install 
```

Hopefully in the future I can get this on npm itself.

## Contributing

There is little need to contribute to this unless it desired to show me
a better way to do something or make a general improvement to something 
that is killing the project in the background. 

## Cloud Architecture

For the time being this app is being hosted on the frontend using Firebase as it
is free for the amount of work that the site will be demanding.
As for the server-side code, that is on azure web services and for the small amount
server-side power that is being used this is perfect because it's free as well. 
The database itself is hosted firebase.

## Deployment

Currently, the project is set to deploy upon merging changes with master using 
github workflows. Anytime a change is made the changes are live within a few minutes 
of receiving the pushed change granted that the build doesn't fail. This applies for both
the frontend and the backend.
